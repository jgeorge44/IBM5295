this diskette is a "standard" 1.44MB 3.5 diskette format. Other than sector 0, it's a DOS format diskette, 80 tracks, 18 sec/track, 512 byte sectors, and 1k clusters.
Sector 0 is an IBM VOL1 diskette label in EBCDIC and not a standard DOS boot sector, so some DOS utilities will think the disk is unreadable.

This particular image, I believe, is corrupt. There are FAT errors and inconsistencies in the directory, which I am trying to recover.

Not having a working 3194 makes this more work than it should be.

The ZIP file in this directory is, I think, the extracted files from the diskette, though they don't look like traditional DOS execuables.
